            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the errours of ſuch as went before us, not nominating any man, is not to be thought a calumnie. For I treat of things that are Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, publike, and for Charities ſake. If therefore I ſhall ſay, that no man was hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heard of, who ſeeking his grounds of curing from Ethnicks, knew the roots of Fevers, or of any other diſeaſes, and their lawful remedies: And further, if I ſhall demonſtrate thus much

                  <p>By me. Though I muſt tell you, that at my firſt entrance, it ſeemed a thing full of unbridled arrogancie to me, that I the leaſt of all men, ſhould brand every one that went before me, with ignorance of Phyloſophical veritie: And that I ſhould attribute the gift of curing to my ſelf onely. I therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord, that he would take his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent into his own hand again, and that he would be pleaſed to rid me wholly of it, and to diſpoſe of it to ſome other, which was more worthy of it, for I knew that he that could be well retired, knew how to live well; at the leaſt morally; eſpecially in time ſo ulcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. I therefore ſtaied awhile, and of late I debate this ignorance of the principles of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, with a purpoſe to propoſe it to this World, that harbour'd it; till being now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, compelled by neceſſity, and being in the agonie of death, I promiſed my God, that I would with all ſweetneſs lay open this his Talent, leſt in his ſtrict judgement I might be thought to have come in vain into the World; and gone from hence again unprofitable. For by a Viſion in my ſleep, it was given me to underſtand, 1. That I feared more the oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies of men, then I did the indignation of God himſelf; 2ly, That nature was crafty in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99588:9"/> pretending out of deceiptful humane reſpects, that the pure obedience to Gods command herein, was pride; and 3ly, That I did not ſee mine own arrogancie, to be placed in a fear, that I ſhould not bring things abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Indeed, I knew that the gates of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick had now for many ages been ſhut up, &amp; that the locks and bolts thereof were covered with ruſt, ſo that I was doubtful of them; as if I preſumed that the porters office had been mine, and not given me from elſwhere. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I reſolved with my ſelf, to do what cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and not what arrogancie ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me; knowing, that he which lookt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Publique, could not be injuſtious, though it were a ſhame to ſuch, as have raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſcribed to the toys and trifles of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; yea, though mankind were thereby da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged.

Whereupon God being juſtly angry, ſuffered this evil and and unprofitable Servant, to be ſifted by the Devil. For an order whoſe <hi>Zenith</hi> is the houſe of powers; and whoſe <hi>Nadir</hi> are all other orders; began to perſecute me cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſs, with unworthy deviſes.

And therefore in the full tempeſt of my perſecutions, I wrote that Volumn which is intituled, <hi>Ortus Medicinae,</hi> that is, <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Phyſica inaudita,</hi> wherein I diſcovered the errours of the Schools, which ordinarily occur in curing.

                  <p>Nay further, though thence I were aſſured, that the manifeſtation, of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived talent of truth, was laid on me: yet is nature eaſily drawn to find excuſes, and deceives her ſelf, and her diſtractions by the helps of reaſon, which attend upon her. For preſently (O fie how much am I aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of mine inconſtancie) I flung the burthen from my ſhoulders which I took
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99588:11"/> upon me; ſaying, O Lord, who am I? I want thoſe more ſolid things, which I ſhould ſurrogate, or put in place of thoſe things, which ſhould be depreſſed. For whatſoever, I had formerly believed, to have been laid as a command upon me; I again ſuſpected, through the ſuggeſted craft of <hi>Sathan.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I wanted hidden remedies <hi>(viz.)</hi> the priviledge, and teſtimonies of my miſſion. Wherefore in my younger dayes, I was long ſince perſwaded; that the very Art of Phyſick was nothing elſe but a meer impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, invented by the idle Graecians, and brought at firſt to that perfection it hath for the deſtruction of the conquering Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and afterwards confirmed, to bring calamities on all men, whereunto our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane credulity, had, through a conceived hope ſo eaſily ſubſcribed: and ſo this Phyſical religion, bred it's own authority; becauſe for the moſt part, wee believe too eaſily that, which we deſire moſt greedily. And ever ſince that time, I aſſured my ſelf that the Phyſick of the Academies, was a thing of nothing; and hereunto as well incurable diſeaſes, as the vanitie of experiments, lend me their votes and ſuffrages; and now at laſt, other helps come flowing in on all ſides,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99588:12"/> becauſe Phyſitians are every where, ſeen to be expoſed to ſcorn and ignominie. And to this my wandring phantaſie, that Philoſophy it ſelf, which is read to youth, now condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth. <hi>Viz</hi> That the Logick, Phyſick, and Metaphyſick of the Schools (for which in times paſt, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> choſe unto him ſome few onely, and thoſe of the better ſort of Schollers, to be inſtructed, under the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of many years ſilence, ratified by an oath, that they would never reveal to any man, any thing of that which he had read unto them,) were not ſuch as we ſuppoſed, but another kind of Doctrine. For I ſuſpected rather, that ſome introductions were there delivered, unto <hi>Pyrotechni,</hi> than unto that ſcience, that <hi>Galen</hi> layes open in a Graecian multiloquacity. Long alſo before <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> every man was accuſtomed, to ſet down faithfully in their Temples, whatſoever had been profitable unto his in Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks: for ſo much neceſſitie, and ſo inward calamitie, had brought that about, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I preſently apprehended in it; Firſt, That he which had created all things, doth notwithſtanding ſingularly glory, that hee created the Phyſitian. Secondly, that for his glory [and] the emanation of his goodneſs, towards the neceſſities, help, and comfort of ſick people; God would be appeaſed by the Phyſitian, in reſtoring that health which he had taken from them. Thirdly, that hee to whom all honour and glory is due, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that onely parents, and thoſe Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians which he created ſhould be honoured; as if the Phyſitian had ſomething of a father in him. Fourthly, in my virility, I after made no ſmall, though doubtfull inquiſition, who that happy man ſhould be, whom the Higheſt had from eternity deſtined, choſen, and created for a Phyſitian, and hence had alſo given command he ſhould be honoured.

Or whether it were he who in the ſame title of Phyſitian, was grown old under anothers ſuffering, and in the mean time, full of years, experiments, and monies? Then I perceived that the infirm ſtood in need of a Phyſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I prove it thus. Every good guift deſcendeth from the Father of Lights: The Adept of curing is a good guift, therefore it deſcendeth from the Father of Lights.

                  <p>Thus, the knowledge of God is of greater difficulty, then that of Phyſick; but the Gentiles by the operations of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99588:18"/> have naturally found out the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of the Deity, therefore have they much more eaſily attained, to the natural Science of Phyſick.</p>

                  <p>No other, or farther fetched, then that it is <hi>de facto,</hi> that ſickneſs, remedies and their appropriations, are at this day unknown
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99588:19"/> to all mortals. For it is an inevitable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that, hitherto the Adept of curing hath been unknown: Therefore God gave it not the Paganiſm in former ages, nor to the Schools which followed thoſe blinde condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. And the correlative of this is, that whoſoever aſſenteth not to the doctrine of the Pagan Schools, is ſecluded from the true principles of curing. Th' Aſſumpt I ſhall God willing demonſtrate in a large Volumn, <hi>viz.</hi> That the principles of the knowledge of cauſes, and roots in diſeaſes, remedies, and appropriations, have remained unknown. The conſequent is cleer of it ſelf, unleſs they can ſhew that every good guift is derived from elſewhere, then from God. For to the eſtabliſhment of the guift of curing, it ſhould ſuffice, that though that guift, be ſo near to the nature of the underſtanding, that for the propinquity and alliances of natural objects, it be cuſtomarily attributed to natural Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, apprehended by a ſimple underſtanding: yet, at leaſt, in that it includes the guifts of prudence, councel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are <hi>Chariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi> or gracious guifts of the Holy Ghoſt: doubtleſs the guift of healing ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, brought, and expected from ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, as is altogether ſcituate above the

The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Fever according to the Schools.</note> examine the definition of a Fever; which the Phyſick Schools define to be, a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural heat, kindled firſt in the heart, and then diſperſed through the whole body. (I add moreover) by their own conſents, that it hutteth many of our actions.</p>

                  <speaker>Py.</speaker>
                  <p>The point of the buſineſs is, that they <note place="margin">3. A prime clauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, about the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites of the Ancients.</note> make the Genus of the thing defined, or the eſſence of a Fever to be heat, and not every heat, but that which is preter-natural, and is in its degree hurtfull. And by that meanes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99588:21"/> ſeeing this heat is eſſential to a fever, that a fever cannot mentally be conceived, but this heat muſt be its individual companion.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Py.</speaker>
                  <p>I pray judge you, but firſt, the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer fevers have of late objected themſelves againſt it, which are without thirſt or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt heat. That is, they act their tragedy from the beginning of the fever to the end of life, without heat.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Whay if they ſay, that theſe fevers <note place="margin">5. A vain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the Schools.</note> were unknown unto the Ancients, and that therefore they are not comprehended under their definition?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Py.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I at leaſt conclude, that theſe fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are no fevers; or the eſſence of fevers is <note place="margin">6. Some doubts following thereon.</note> not neceſſarily tied to heat, but by accident onely. And that therefore the definition of fevers anciently delivered, and at this day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo kept in Schools, is not adjuſted to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a fever. And thirdly, whoſoever ſhall for ſome hours, feel an intrinſecable, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable cold, in the beginning of fevers, and ſhould for all that, perſwade himſelf his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is begun, or that it is preſent on him; but ſome other diſeaſe hitherto nameleſs: and though he chatter with his teeth, ſhake with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99588:22"/> cold, and have his lips blew therewith, and yet perſwades himſelf, that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe inconveniences, thoſe beginnings, are no beginnings of fevers: nor that hee which dies in ſuch beginnings, (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly falls out, in intermittent fevers) dies of a true [and real] fever: Beleeve them who will [for me] for I am not wont, in contingies, known by the ſenſe of feeling, in that I am ſo ſtupid, that in things ſenſible, I ſtand unto no other judgement then that of the ſenſes.</p>

                  <p>But ſome hold, that grouling cold, and <note place="margin">7. Other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions.</note> ſhakings, are not the beginnings of fevers: but the beginnings of the fit.</p>

                  <p>Theſe are ſuch who ſticking cloſer to the opinion of the ancients, then others, creep into corners, that they may maintain the ſenſe of <hi>Galen:</hi> but <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf ſhakes theſe men off, ſaying: We firſt underſtand by the name of Paroxiſm, the worſe part of the whole fit, or acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But are there not yet others, who ſay <note place="margin">8.

                  <p>Theſe are ſuch, as would rather not ſee, or not be ſenſible, though their eys be open. But theſe are madneſſes, which every country fellow will huſh out of the middle of a village. In that for ſome hours, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails are poſſeſſed, with a moſt eager, or intenſe coldneſs. For in ſo plain and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an hiſtory of cold (which is of fact and ſenſible) the argument which they produce <note place="margin">9. A looſe argument of theſe men.</note> is very feeble: they ſay there is inwardly a great heat, though the Patients feel it not; their reaſon is, becauſe they are oppreſſed with a continual thirſt; which as it is prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a figne of ſiccitie, ſo this ſiccity in living creatures preſuppoſeth an heat equal to it. And that from hence thirſt deſerves to bee of greater authority, then ſenſe is.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall when wee come to diſcourſe of the efficient cauſe of fevers. In the mean time this being violently obtained; it follows at leaſt, that the peccant, or offending mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fevers, is not properly kindled; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it in its ſelf primarily, and efficiently hot, nor heats it preternaturally; if the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamable muſt be kindled in the heart. Nor is the peccant matter thereof hot above, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the degree of Nature in a fever. But that which is kindled in the heart, was not inflamed before the fit of the fever; and by that meanes, it altogether differeth from the peccant, or offending matter in fevers.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>It may fitly then, be hence concluded, <note place="margin">18. A fourth.</note> that whoſoever goes about, to take away a fever by coolers; hath no intention to cure by taking away the cauſes, or cutting up the roots, or by draining, and emptying the fountain thereof, or that which doth exile it: but they intend onely to take away, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the heat, which is a kinde of product, which comes afterward, and lodgeth not in the feveriſh matter. For they apply their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies <hi>adpoſterius, non adprius,</hi> to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and not their cauſes.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>They therefore look [onely as I ſaid] to the taking away of the conſequent effect, and that which reſulteth out of the poſition of that root.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Py.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis ſo, and hence you may ſee that the <hi>Archeus</hi> is not inflamed from the root, but from a heat drawn from elſewhere.</p>

                  <p>Whil'ſt this ſpirit inflameth it's ſelf by its ſtrugling, and by its own heat raiſed to ſuch a degree [thereby] as is far above that, which it hath need of, or is befitting it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it becomes wholly troubleſome; as being delated further then it ſhould be, and above the neceſſity that is of it.

                  <p>Nay, that which is more; a dead <note place="margin">24.

                  <p>But this error is thus diſcovered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a fever which made a live body hot, preſently after death ceaſeth, and all heat <note place="margin">25.

And this ſhould inſtruct us, that feveriſh heat is not proper to the peccant matter, or that it doth inhabit in it; as alſo; that the heat of that matter, doth not efficiently, and effectively heat in fevers. And <note place="margin">26. Feveriſh matter heateth occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> therefore it is perpetually true, that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding matter, heateth occaſionally onely: But the <hi>Archeus</hi> is the worker of all alteration, and therefore under this title, that way-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſpirit, is it, which efficiently, primarily, immediately, alwayes, every where, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heateth; according to that Axiom: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <note place="margin">27.

                  <p>Comes this by reaſon that hot hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours have their affluence, thither, as if they had been called by that thorn, and had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the wound thereof, which otherwiſe had been temperately quiet in their proper places?</p>

                  <p>Right, for th'inflamation, the ſwelling, the hardneſs of the pulſe, the pain, and hear, that are in the wound, come all onely from the ſpirit, cauſally: but from the infixed thorn alone, occaſionally.</p>

                  <p>Verily this is a ſufficient example, as <note place="margin">29. To heat, and to be hot how different.</note> well for the poſition, manner, and knowing; as alſo for the curing of a fever. Teaching that the peccant cauſe in a fever, is not hot in its

And the ſame ſhall never after putrefie, if it be ſprinkled; But onely while it is heaped together moiſt, and in that moiſtneſs preſſed together, it is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before the Putrefaction thereof, in the ſame manner that bay, and flowers are.

And in concluſion, though dung wax hot, while the putrefaction is in making, yet all the heat ceaſeth, before the beginning of the putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made.

And in fine heat is not kindled in dung, out <note place="margin">15. Dung not hot from putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> of its own putredneſs.

                  <p>This argument at leaſt convinceth, that one part of the bloud is more, or ſooner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed then another, and not the whole and all together.

                  <p>It ſhould ſeem then, that the Schools intend not the cooling of the heat by bloud-letting: but primarily, the taking away of bloud, and mitigation of accidents, which wait upon the dejected forces: or, they pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily intend, a diminution both of bloud and forces.</p>

For he commanded it not, out of fear of the fulneſs, though their veines did ſufficiently abound with bloud: but onely that their veſſels ſo filled, might not by the exerciſing of their ſtrength be broken, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſtrained: otherwiſe, what have Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers which are found, to do with cures belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging unto fevers?

                  <p>My reaſon is, that ſuch as are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by bloud letting, are for the moſt part deprived of the benefit of a Criſis.

But ſuch as lye ſick of a diſeaſe wherein bloud letting hath not been uſed, come preſently to their wonted ſtrength again, and are reſtored eaſily. But if by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of remedies, they ſometimes come unto the extremity; yet Nature endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth a Criſis, and relievs them; becauſe their forces (though ſhaken much by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity) yet they are not periſhed, as being not exhauſted by their bloud letting, which they ſo ſpeedily and abundantly.</p>

So that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of breathing out of the purrefaction, (which I have proved to be truly nothing) there be not rather a free acceſs of putted

In like manner, let them expreſs themſelves, what they mean when they ſay, that bloud ſhould be let, or drawn, that the Arteries may breath more freely; conſidering that putrefaction, (if there were any ſuch thing poſſibly to bee found within the veins) affecteth not the arterial bloud, which is the Steward of our whole Nature.
